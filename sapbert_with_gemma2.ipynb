            "* **Rigid insistence on specific routines involving phone use:** This demonstrates the strong need for structure and predictability often seen in ASD.\n",
            "* **Limited reciprocal social interaction:** Social communication and interaction challenges are core features of ASD.\n",
            "* **Challenges adjusting to changes in routine or environment:** This reflects the difficulty many individuals with ASD experience when faced with unexpected situations.\n",
